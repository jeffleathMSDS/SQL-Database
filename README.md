# SQL-Database

I was working for a privately held business that was in the industrial serivces business.  It was very much project driven, with percentage of completion accounting a major emphasis.  There primary source of project information was an old main frame system that had antiquate capabilities in terms of operational interaction and facilitation of forward leaning project/cost/profit/cash management.

As an 'Agile' style solution, I rapidly built the shell of a SQL database structure to solve some immediate functionality issues.  I used MS Access and structured it as a 'Back-End' / 'Front-End' model.  I used multiple backend databases on a shared server to hold the transactional data and created a 'Front-End' db client that I could put on a user's (i.e. Project Manager) desktop.  I also had another db that acted as an 'Admin' console and essentially acted as an ETL for the whole system.

Of course, the db's need to be linked via the linked table manager, depending on the file/server structure being used.

I know there are way more appropriate/off-the-shelf systems out there, but I had zero budget, no higher echelon support, and an immediate need... hence this Agile solution.  It proved effective.

* As a note, the data (in the uploaded tables) has been manipulated in a fashion only know be me, so it not 'true' or 'confidential'.
